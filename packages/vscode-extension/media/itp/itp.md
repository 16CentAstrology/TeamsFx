# Prepare a Qualified Microsoft 365 Account for Teams App Development

## Account Requirements

The following two conditions are required for Teams app development:

1. The Microsoft 365 account should be your work or school account, not your personal account.
2. The Microsoft 365 account should be granted with permission to upload custom app in Teams.

You can contact your tenant administrator to turn on the upload custom app permission for your organization.

Or if you are a Visual Studio Subscriber, you can create a qualified Microsoft 365 developer account to resolve the account issues you may have. You will need to join Microsoft 365 Developer Program to get the developer account.
